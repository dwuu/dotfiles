DESCRIPTION:

Week 12 homework for EECS398

Made symbolic links in my home directory to ~/Dotfiles like so:
	ln -s ~/Dotfiles/.[filename] ~/.[filename]

ssh caen logs in to caen

I regularly use some of the aliases in my .bash_aliases, and frequently have to play around with my $PATH using .bash_profile.  I also have a custom message of the day (motd) that I print from .bashrc every time I open a new session.
